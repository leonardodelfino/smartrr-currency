# Currency Converter Application

## Project Overview

This project is a set of applications utilizing Node.js, TypeScript, and React, developed by **Leonardo Delfino** (<leonardodelfino@gmail.com>). It interacts with the Currency Converter API to continuously fetch and display the currency conversion rates between USD and BRL for the last 24 hours. It is composed of multiple systems, including the front-end, back-end API, a cron job for data updates, and a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or later
- Docker
- Docker Compose

- **currency-front**: This is the front-end of the application, developed in React. It communicates with the `currency-api` to retrieve and display currency conversion rates.

- **currency-api**: The back-end API built with Node.js and TypeScript. It serves as the intermediary between the front-end and the database. It also handles requests from the `currency-cron` for data updates.

- **mongodb**: The database where currency conversion data is stored.

- **currency-cron**: A Node.js application responsible for running scheduled jobs to fetch data from the Currency Converter API and save it to the database. It communicates with the `currency-api`.
